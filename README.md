# OpenSourceGovernance
A proposal for using open source code to monitor financial systems and protect constitutional rights.
Thousands of Linux programmers check the source code and fix it if there are more interesting solutions. They can also monitor constitutional rights of citizens in this code, and monitor banking programs and applications. Give them a salary and gradual training for beginnersâ€”what's stopping this from being a ready project? Governance in the state through open source code.
